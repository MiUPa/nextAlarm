# Google Play listing (Gradle Play Publisher)

This directory is used by the `com.github.triplet.play` Gradle plugin to upload store listing text and release notes.

Place images (screenshots, feature graphic, etc.) under the locale-specific `graphics/` folders if you want to upload them via Gradle.

Existing image sources live in:
- `store_assets/feature_graphic/`
- `store_assets/screenshots/`
